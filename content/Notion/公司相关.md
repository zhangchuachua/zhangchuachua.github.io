## **Mac**

### **环境变量**

mac 在不同情况下使用的是不同的环境变量；比如说网上说的最多的 .bash_profile 这个文件用于bash脚本，但是 Mac 默认使用的是zsh，所以会造成设置了 .bash_profile 但是不起作用的情况。 [bash与zsh，全局环境变量，用于环境变量讲解](https://www.jianshu.com/p/caca1feba3a6)

## **Linux**

### **命令**

- 基本命令：[https://blog.csdn.net/ljianhui/article/details/11100625](https://blog.csdn.net/ljianhui/article/details/11100625)
- vim命令：[https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-vim.html](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-vim.html)
- 文件、文件夹相关命令：[https://blog.csdn.net/linjpg/article/details/77854671](https://blog.csdn.net/linjpg/article/details/77854671)
- 压缩可以使用： ditto 也可以使用 zip，zip还没通过 但是 ditto 需要传递参数，不然就只是单纯的复制粘贴文件夹。 `ditto -c -k . <需要打包的文件夹路径>` 解压缩使用 [unzip](https://www.runoob.com/linux/linux-comm-unzip.html)，基本的命令： `unzip -d <解压的指定位置> <解压的压缩包>`
- ssh命令：[https://www.cnblogs.com/ftl1012/p/ssh.html](https://www.cnblogs.com/ftl1012/p/ssh.html)

**The Harvest of Hope**

In the small town of Greenfield, the **arrival** of autumn signaled the beginning of the **harvest** season. Every year, the townsfolk eagerly awaited this time, as the fields were filled with **crops** that had been carefully tended to since spring.
